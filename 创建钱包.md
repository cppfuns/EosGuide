####创建账户

#####What is an EOS account?
> 
An account is a human-readable name that is stored on the blockchain.
An account is required to transfer or otherwise push a transaction to the blockchain.

#####Can I change my account name?
>
Not until the EOS mainnet launches. After the mainnet launches, you will be able to create new account names. The actual ins and outs will be announced.

#####Will my account name change?
>
It is unlikely to change at this point. Please come back later to check if your account name has changed.

#####How are account names assigned?
>
All EOS account names on launch are 12 characters long. The account names are based on when the Ethereum wallet was first seen also padding genesis at the end.

#####What is block one's account name?

Well Block one gets to keep the awesome account name: b1
